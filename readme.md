This script creates a frequency table from the Easy German podcasts. For instance, "ich,8930" indicates that the word "ich" was said 8930 times. This script assumes that the files to be analyzed are in html format as offered in the Patreon's page and located in the same folder as the script. Basic knowledge on how to execute Python script is assumed, as well as the machine where the script is run has all the libraries that were important and Python 3 installed.

To execute it: using the terminal, go to the directory where the script and the html file(s) is/are located and type: python3 ./easy_german_unique_words.py

In the same folder, a text file called freqTable will be created containing the words and how many times they were said.
